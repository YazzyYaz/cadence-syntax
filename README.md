# Cadence Vim Syntax File

This is the cadence.vim file for all `*.cdc` files.

[Cadence](https://docs.onflow.org/cadence) is a smart-contract language for [Flow Blockchain](https://www.onflow.org/).

Still an early version with some missing syntax highlighting, including the following:
* Missing `/* */` Multi-line comment highlighting.
* Numbers and strings missing highlighting

Feel free to fork this repo or submit a PR with an update to the file and I'll add you as an author.
